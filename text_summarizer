Artificial Intelligence is transforming the world at a rapid pace. From healthcare to education,
AI-powered systems are improving efficiency and decision-making. Natural Language Processing,
a branch of AI, helps machines understand human language. Technologies like chatbots,
voice assistants, and translation systems are built using NLP. With the rise of deep learning
and transformer models like BERT and GPT, NLP systems have become more powerful and accurate.
AI continues to grow and influence industries worldwide.
