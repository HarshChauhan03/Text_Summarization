This project demonstrates **Automatic Text Summarization** using a pre-trained Transformer model from HuggingFace.

The system takes a long paragraph as input and generates a shorter, meaningful summary while preserving the key information.

## 📌 What is Text Summarization?

Text Summarization is an NLP task that converts a long piece of text into a shorter version while retaining the most important information.

There are two main types:

- **Extractive Summarization** → Selects important sentences from the original text  
- **Abstractive Summarization** → Generates new sentences that summarize the text  

This project uses **Abstractive Summarization** powered by Transformers.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

✅ Use a pre-trained Transformer model  
✅ Generate meaningful summaries from long text  
✅ Demonstrate modern NLP capabilities  
✅ Apply state-of-the-art AI without training from scratch

## 🧠 How It Works

Input Paragraph
↓
Tokenizer
↓
Transformer Model (Pretrained)
↓
Generated Summary


The model understands context and meaning before generating a concise summary.
